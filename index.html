      <p><b><u>Career Goals:</b></u> In a male-dominated industry of engineering, the presence of women is greatly neglected and is much needed because even women have astonishing ideas that deserve the worldâ€™s acceptance. Arpita Shanbhag strives to bridge the gender divide in the era of technological development. everyday, she works on making the gap closer day-by-day until this separation no longer exists. She encourages her female peers to pursue the engineering pathway in school and clubs and writes content about the inequality in the engineering workforce, not only for women but for everyone. Being a woman in this field during this period poses some hardships, and Arpita wants to ensure that females in future generations will not have to receive the same discrimination she does today. When she grows up, she wants to be in a supportive community along with her fellow supportive female software engineers.</p></div>
